                         <p align="left">After completing my Senior Secondary Education I started my studies for Undergraduation at SRMIST ktr campus under Electronics and Communication Engineering Department.
                        The main campus of this institute is situated at around 35Km from the chennai city at Kanchipuram distict near Potheri.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">I have scored a commulative gpa of 7.23 till my 6th semsester and a total percentage of 81.4.                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p align="left"><strong>Obstacle Detector Cum Vacuum Detector:</strong></p>
                    <p align="left">A suction system was mounted on the the self directing car.The base car was equipped with IR sensor which determines the presence of obstacle and at the top it was equipped with Ultrasonic sensor which determines the distance of the upcomming obstacle.
                        The Vacuum part was mounted on this bsae car.This vacuum was fitted with motor and a switching system which turns on and off as per the distance of the obstacle.
                    </p>
                    <p align="left"><strong>Seven Segmment Display Using Logic Gates</strong></p>
                    <p align="left">This was a part of curriculum project of Digital System Lab. In this project the 7-segment display was lighted according to the given input without using the available inbuilt IC for it.
                        AND, NOT, NOR, etc gates were used to implement this project on bread-board and was powered with a 9V battery and a voltage regulator was used along with various resistors for proper functioning </p>

                    <p align="left"><strong>RFID bases Home Security System</strong></p>
                    <p align="left">This was a part of curriculum project of Microprocessor Lab.It was basically a door unlocking system using electronic key. RFID cards were used as a key and a RFID sensor as a lock. Each valid RFID information was stored in the RFID sensor which autheticates the user.
                         If the RFID card's data matches with the feeded data then it sends positive signals other wise it blows up alarm to alert. </p>
                     
                    <p align="left"><strong>Audio Amplifier using Op-Amp</strong></p>
                    <p align="left">This was a part of curriculum project of Linear Integrated Circuit Lab. In this project audio was amplified using Op-Amp , resistors, capacitor and transistor.The basic idea was to amplify the input signal without using costly equipment as used in other amplifiers</p>

                    <p align="left"><strong>Fire Alarm</strong></p>
                    <p align="left">This project was a part if curriculum project of Electronic circuit lab. This project was made to sense the abruptbly increased temperature of the surrounding and notifys by blowing buzzer. The project was made by using Thermistor, Opamp,Resistor, potentiometer,Buzzer etc.</p>
                        
                    <p align="left"><strong>Water Level Indicator</strong></p>
                    <p align="left">This project was a part of curriculum project of Circuit lab. In this project the circuit design was so designed that at each particular level of water in the tank it completes a conducting path and that turns on the particular LED indicating the level of water in the tank</p>
